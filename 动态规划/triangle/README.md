Figure 1 shows a number triangle. Write a program that calculates the highest sum of numbers passed on a route that starts at the top and ends somewhere on the base. Each step can go either diagonally down to the left or diagonally down to the right.

#输入

Your program is to read from standard input. The first line contains one integer N: the number of rows in the triangle. The following N lines describe the data of the triangle. The number of rows in the triangle is > 1 but <= 100. The numbers in the triangle, all integers, are between 0 and 99.

#输出

Your program is to write to standard output. The highest sum is written as an integer.
